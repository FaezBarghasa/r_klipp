//! # S-Curve (Jerk-Limited) Motion Planner
//!
//! This module translates high-level move requests into a series of timed
//! `StepCommand`s using a third-order motion profile (S-curve) for smoother
//! acceleration and deceleration, reducing vibrations and improving print quality.
//!
//! ## Operation
//!
//! 1.  **`plan_move`**: A high-level move is received. The planner calculates the
//!     parameters for an S-curve profile, including phases of increasing/decreasing
//!     acceleration (jerk). This is stored as a `MoveSegment`.
//!
//! 2.  **`generate_steps`**: The main firmware loop calls this function to dequeue
//!     a `MoveSegment` and generate one `StepCommand` for each step of the dominant
//!     axis. The step interval calculation now follows the S-curve profile.
//!
//! 3.  **Junction Deviation**: The planner calculates the maximum velocity at the
//!     junction between two moves to allow for faster, smoother cornering without
//!     coming to a complete stop.
